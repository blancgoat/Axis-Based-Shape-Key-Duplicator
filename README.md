X-axis should be set to 0,  
And checked it because I need a reference to the Y-axis coordinates based on one vertex. it is 1.4063.
(This model has its mesh lying down before rigging, so the reference axis is the Y-axis. In most cases, you’ll probably need to use the Z-axis.)

After selecting the axis shape in the sidebar, select the object and then choose the shape key. Then, add the appropriate values. I did it as shown in the picture.

and click 'Create Shape Key'  
job done!  
The important point is that the mouth does not move with that key.    
Rename key. In this case, 'cheekSquintLeft' seems like an appropriate name.
